# Introduction

This vignette reviews basic aspects of interacting with omicidx to
obtain metadata about metagenomics studies available in NCBI SRA.

## A quick view of a query about a study

To get things rolling, let's assume we know the identifier for
an SRA _study_ of interest: SRP114847.  How we discover identifiers
for studies or families of studies will be discussed later.

We can obtain a rectangular table of information about SRP114847
by querying a specific _endpoint_ of the omicidx API.  We'll
use the "runs for study" endpoint and then discuss why and how afterwards.
