# md4mg -- metadata for (curated) metagenomics

This site provides background on metadata handling for the
[Waldronlab](https://github.com/waldronlab) [curatedMetagenomicsData project](https://waldronlab.io/curatedMetagenomicData/).

The primary metadata generation/access resource is the 
[OmicIDX system](https://api.omicidx.cancerdatasci.org/swaggerdoc) by Sean Davis of NCI.

Our objective in this site is to explain and exercise OmicIDX, as fully as is necessary
for the use of curated metagenomics data.
